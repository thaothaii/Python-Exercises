# Spend analysis exercise
## Case of public healthcare spending under COVID-19 pandemic

### Objective
In this exercise, the objective is to conduct a spend analysis on one public organization and to
address a following high-level question:

*How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the public spending in the Finnish healthcare sector?*

### Organization 
**Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare** 
(in Finnish: Terveyden ja Hyvinvoinnin Laitos, THL), the government’s expert organization on health-related matters

### Data Sources
Annual invoice data for all Finnish governmental agencies is available at:
https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/tutkihankintoja-data

Each year’s data since 2016 is available as an independent csv-file.
The data files are in Finnish but a separate Excel-file (th_kaannokset.xlsx) containing translations for each procurement unit can be found in the data-translation folder.  Variable translations are available on the download page.

The data analyzed in this exercise is from 2017 to 2021, with the main focus on 2020 and 2021.
To filter Invoices of Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, choose “Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos”
(National Institute for Health and Welfare1) in variable “hankintayksikkö” (procurement_unit).

### Analysis

The analysis aims to address the following questions:
1. How big is the spending and how has it developed?
2. Compared to spend volume, does the procurement unit have many or few suppliers? How is the spend distributed by the suppliers / by the procurement categories (e.g., are certain suppliers dominating certain categories etc.)?
3. How either the total spending, its distribution per category, supplier or account, or number of suppliers (or any other distinguishable factor) has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?
